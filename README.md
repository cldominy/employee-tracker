# Employee Tracker

This employee tracker was built using SQL databases to contain various information about employees through 3 tables: departments, roles, and employees. Each table can be updated by using inquirer to follow through a series of prompts. Additionally, a user can view the SQL data tables without having to leave the program. By opening a terminal and using node to run the server, the user can view each table by utilizing console table npm.
